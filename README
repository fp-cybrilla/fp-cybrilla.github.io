## Release notes conventions
1. Organize the release details by month and dates within a month.
2. The release details must be sorted in descending order with latest release always appearing on top.
3. Don't use <br> tag for line breaks. Use more spaces or blackslash for line breaks instead of <br> tag. Reference : https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/markdown.html#newlines
4. If you want a line-break in bulleted list, please use two trailing space followed by newline. See existing release notes for examples.
