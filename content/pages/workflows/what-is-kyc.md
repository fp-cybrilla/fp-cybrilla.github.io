#### What is KYC?

As per the regulator SEBI, banks and financial institutions (FIs) have been advised to follow a certain customer identification procedure for opening of accounts and monitor transactions of suspicious nature for the purpose of reporting the same to an appropriate authority. These ‘Know Your Customer’ (KYC) guidelines have been published in the context of the recommendations made 
by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) on Anti Money Laundering (AML) standards and on Combating Financing of Terrorism (CFT).
