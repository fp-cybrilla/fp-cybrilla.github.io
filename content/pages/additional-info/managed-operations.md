## Managed Operations
-------------------------------------------

#### What is `Managed Operations`?
The platform also offers the unique facility of automatically handling the entire operations with RTA's, while you focus on what truly matters, your customer.

#### What happens if an exception or a failure occurs?
A dedicated operations team handles the complete follow up with the RTA's to solve the problem respectively.

#### Do I need an Operations team?
None at all. Cybrillaâ€™s managed operations team has been built to bring down the unnecessary high costs of this activity and help you focus on your core business.

#### How does the Operations team communicate?
A dedicated SPOC will be assigned to you, who will be interacting with the various agencies and stakeholders on behalf of you.

#### How do we gauge the performance of your Operations team?
We share an Operations health report with our customers on a monthly basis. This helps them gain business insights into the operations for their respective end customers through various metrics.

#### Is it billed separately?
There is complete flexibility on what blocks you wish to pick and choose for your business. The Operations block (module) is an independent block as part of the blocks on the platform and will be billed seperately, like other blocks.
