*Understand the implications of EUIN on your commissions*

For MF transactions placed through FP, we take care of the mandatory guidelines around EUIN, so you receive your commissions without any hiccups.

For past transactions or transactions happening offline to FP, there might be chances that the EUIN guidelines are not followed and hence your brokerage for such transactions are held by the AMCs. With FP, you can fix those transactions and get your commissions released.
