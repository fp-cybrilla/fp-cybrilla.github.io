## MF Orders
#### Buy and sell mutual funds for your investors with FP Order APIs

Order APIs give you the ability to place purchase and sell orders on behalf of your investor. Using FP APIs, you can either create one time orders or you can create recurring orders.

**One time orders**
1. [Create a onetime purchase](/mf-transactions/onetime-purchases)
2. [Sell a mutual fund](/mf-transactions/onetime-redemptions)
3. [Switch from one scheme to another](/mf-transactions/onetime-switches)

**Recurring purchases**
1. [Create a new SIP](/mf-transactions/purchase-plans/create-monthly-sip)
2. [Top up amount for an SIP](/mf-transactions/purchase-plans/topup-sip)
3. [Pause installments of an existing SIP](/mf-transactions/purchase-plans/pause-sip)
4. [Renew the tenure of an SIP](/mf-transactions/purchase-plans/renew-sip/)

`Investment Account` object is the starting point for placing any orders. You need to create an investment account for your investor before you can start placing purchase and sell orders. Follow [these steps](/mf-transactions/investment-account) to create an investment account.
