# MF Orders
*Buy and sell mutual funds for your investors with FP Order APIs*

Order APIs give you the ability to place purchase and sell orders on behalf of your investor. You can  
1. place a [one time investment order](/mf-transactions/onetime-purchases)
2. schedule a [recurring investment (SIP)](/mf-transactions/recurring-purchases)
3. place a [redemption request](/mf-transactions/onetime-redemptions)

`Investment Account` object is the starting point for placing any orders. You need to create an investment account for your investor before you can start placing purchase and sell orders. Follow [these steps](/mf-transactions/investment-account) to create an investment account.
