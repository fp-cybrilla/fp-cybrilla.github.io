## Recurring Orders

[Transaction plans](https://fintechprimitives.com/docs/api/#fp-transaction-plans) are used to generate orders on a recurring basis.
The user can use the transaction plan APIs to create two types of plans - 
1. Systematic Plans (SIP/ SWP/ STP) 
2. Non-Systematic Plans

### What is a Non-Systematic Plan?
A non-systematic plan has the same behaviour as that of a systematic plan, but is not registered as a systematic plan in RTA. Instead it is registered as a series of lumpsum orders generated at the frequency specified by the user during the non-systematic plan creation.

> A non-systematic plan can be created by creating a transaction plan with `systematic` = false.


### Transaction Plan Lifecycle

1. User creates a transaction plan. The plan immediately becomes `active` upon plan creation. 
2. Once the plan becomes active, installments are generated by FP as per the `installment_day` and `frequency` of the plan. Refer [Installment Generation Lifecycle](#installment-generation-lifecycle) section below to understand the flow of installments.
3. Once all the installments of the plan have been generated, the plan state changes to `completed`.
4. The user can also choose to modify an active plan. Please refer [Transaction Plan Modifications](#transaction-plan-modifications) for more info.

### Transaction Plan Modifications
1. After the plan is active, the user has the option to modify the plan as per his requirement -
   - If the plan is systematic (`systematic` = true), the user can modify the plan amount.
   - If the plan is non-systematic (`systematic` = false), the user can modify the plan amount, installment day and number of installments. 
2. The user can also opt to pause a plan between a given timeframe. Upon pausing the plan, for all the installments that fall under the time frame, FP generates the installments and marks them as `cancelled`. 

> If a user wants to modify a plan right from the next installment, the plan must be modified at least 2 calendar days before the next installment is scheduled.

### Installment Generation Lifecycle
For every installment of a plan, FP creates a MF order.
So the lifecycle of a transaction plan installment is the same as that of a MF order.
To understand more about the installment lifecycle refer [Orders Lifecycle](/mf-transactions/orders-introduction/#orders-lifecycle)
