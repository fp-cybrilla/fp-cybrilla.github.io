### Payment failure codes and their meaning
The following are the failure codes and corresponding failure reasons that you may encounter in the callback response or within the payment object when a payment fails after creation, particularly at the payment provider level. The `failure code` can be used for programmatic actions upon payment failure or for creating custom failure messages displayed to investors. The `failure reason` can be directly shown to investors while the `explanation` is provided for your understanding.

Please be aware that this list is not exhaustive, and we will continue to update it as more codes are added in the future.

> As of now, failure codes are specifically populated for Billdesk as the payment provider.
