[SEBI/HO/IMD/DF2/CIR/P/2020/253](https://www.sebi.gov.in/legal/circulars/dec-2020/circular-on-mutual-funds_48630.html) dated December 31, 2020, effective from February 1, 2021, the Net Asset Value (NAV) date applicable to all mutual fund purchases will be the date on which funds are received by the fund house (or AMC).

In the past, fund houses could provisionally allocate units based on the NAV on the date the order was placed, whereas the funds were received later via payment systems.The provisional allotment is now discontinued. However, the above rule is already applicable for purchase transactions under Liquid funds and Overnight Funds.

### How does it affect investors ?

 1. The investor may not get the same NAV if the payment modes are other than Net Banking(Direct) or UPI.
 2. The time taken for the realization of funds depends on the payment mode. The below table shows when the NAV allotment happens based on the chosen payment mode.

## Why does unit allotment take T+1 Days for all other banks in Net Banking ?**

Generally net banking in BSE is categorised into two types:

 1. Direct Banks
 2. Nodal Banks

Direct Banks in Net Banking refers to transfers where Investor and the BSEStarMF, have accounts within the same bank. Currently BSE supports net banking with the following banks :

 - ICICI Bank - Retail Net Banking
 - Axis Bank
 - Kotak Mahindra Bank
 - IDBI Bank - Retail Net Banking
 - Yes Bank
 - AU Small Finance Bank
 - HDFC Bank
 - State Bank of India

All other banks other than those above are referred to as Nodal Banks.
Funds transfer are faster for direct net banking transfers and can take upto 1 business day for Nodal banks depending on the bank.
